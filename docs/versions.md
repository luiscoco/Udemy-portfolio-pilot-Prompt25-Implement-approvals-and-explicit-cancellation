# PortfolioPilot toolchain (milestone 01)

Verified on **2026-09-30**. These are exact intended direct dependency versions for milestone 02 and later. Keep matching package versions exact in workspace manifests; generate and commit `package-lock.json` when dependencies can be installed and a commit is authorized. No packages were installed in milestone 01.

| Tool or package | Selected version | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Node.js | **24.21.0 LTS** | All JavaScript development and server runtimes |
| npm | **11.19.0** | Bundled with Node.js 24.21.0; npm workspaces |
| `react` | **19.3.0** | Vite web application |
| `react-dom` | **19.3.0** | Same React release as `react` |
| `vite` | **8.3.1** | Web development/build |
| `typescript` | **5.9.3** | Shared compiler version |
| `next` | **16.3.8** | Node.js API Route Handlers only |
| `prisma` | **7.10.0** | CLI and migrations |
| `@prisma/client` | **7.10.0** | Generated client; match Prisma CLI |
| `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` | **0.3.276** | Server-only agent runtime |
| `zod` | **4.6.4** | Shared and server validation |
| `vitest` | **5.0.0** | Unit/integration tests |
| `@playwright/test` | **1.63.0** | Browser end-to-end tests |

## Compatibility basis

- [Node.js release status](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases) lists 24 as LTS. The [24.21.0 archive](https://nodejs.org/en/download/archive/v24.21.0) records npm 11.19.0. Pinning one LTS patch makes lessons repeatable. Node 26 was still Current on the verification date.
- [React's release list](https://react.dev/versions) and [19.3 announcement](https://react.dev/blog/2026/09/09/react-19-3) confirm 19.3.0 is stable. The [npm React DOM listing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom?activeTab=versions) lists 19.3.0 as stable; keep `react` and `react-dom` identical. No canary or release candidate is selected.
- The [Next.js 16.3.8 registry manifest](https://registry.npmjs.org/next/16.3.8) declares Node `>=20.9.0` and peer dependencies `react` and `react-dom` `^18.2.0 || 19.0.0-rc-de68d2f4-20241204 || ^19.0.0`. React 19.3.0 satisfies the stable `^19.0.0` range. The [Next.js installation docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/installation) also document Node 20.9+ and TypeScript 5.1+.
- The [Vite 8.3 npm listing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite?activeTab=versions) identifies 8.3.1 as stable. The [Vite 8 announcement](https://v8.vite.dev/blog/announcing-vite8) requires Node 20.19+ or 22.12+; Node 24.21.0 is a supported newer LTS line.
- The [Prisma 7 package listings](https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40prisma/client?activeTab=versions) identify 7.10.0 for `@prisma/client`, and the [Prisma release-status page](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/release-status) says Prisma 8 is a release candidate as of this verification. Select `prisma` and `@prisma/client` together at stable 7.10.0. [Prisma 7 requirements](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/v7/reference/system-requirements) allow Node `^24.0.0` and TypeScript 5.4+; its [v7 upgrade guide](https://docs.prisma.io/docs/orm/v6/more/upgrades/to-v7) recommends TypeScript 5.9.x and ESM. This is why TypeScript 5.9.3 is selected instead of the newer 7.x line.
- Anthropic's [SDK 0.3.276 release](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-typescript/releases/tag/v0.3.276) confirms the version, and its [changelog](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-typescript/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) records Zod 4 as an accepted peer range. The [Zod npm listing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zod?activeTab=versions) confirms 4.6.4 as a stable 4.x version. The SDK's installed type definitions and full package peer/engine metadata remain to be checked at installation; do not assume an SDK method or model ID from this document.
- [Vitest 5 migration guidance](https://main.vitest.dev/guide/migration/) requires Vite 6.4+ and Node 22.12+; Vite 8.3.1 and Node 24.21.0 clear those floors. The [Vitest npm listing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vitest?activeTab=readme) confirms 5.0.0. The [Playwright npm listing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40playwright/test) and [official release notes](https://playwright.dev/docs/release-notes) confirm 1.63.0. Playwright browser binaries are a separate local installation.

At milestone 01, registry package pages and the Next.js registry manifest were checked through web access. Direct npm registry access from that PowerShell session failed, so the compatibility claims above were not then a report of a successful local install. The milestone 02 update below records the later installation.

## Milestone 02 resolution update (2026-09-30)

The approved direct runtime versions above were installed without substitutions; `package-lock.json` now records the resolved graph. The scaffold additionally needs exact TypeScript declaration packages: `@types/node` 24.10.0, `@types/react` 19.2.7, and `@types/react-dom` 19.2.3. These versions resolved and compiled with the approved Node/React/TypeScript set. `@playwright/test` remains a planned version; milestone 02 has no browser automation suite or browser binary install. `npm install` succeeded with 295 packages. npm reported that Prisma 7.10.0 install scripts were not allowlisted; Prisma generation is deferred to milestone 06, when its schema exists.

The normal npm shim is blocked by the local NVM trust check, but invoking the installed npm CLI with the installed Node executable works. Registry access required sandbox escalation. The root scripts were verified through that direct invocation. The installed Next.js type definitions and bundled agent guide were inspected for `agentRules`; the option is set to false to avoid generation of nested assistant instruction files.

## Milestone 03 additions (2026-09-30)

The web workspace adds `react-router` 8.3.0 for declarative client routes and `@tanstack/react-query` 5.102.8 for server state. It also installs the previously planned `@playwright/test` 1.63.0 for local browser verification. All are pinned exactly in the manifest and lockfile. React Router's official declarative-mode documentation confirms `BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, `Route`, and `NavLink` usage; TanStack Query's installation documentation confirms React 18+ compatibility and the `QueryClientProvider` pattern. Styling uses project CSS, so no component library was needed. No previous direct dependency was upgraded for this milestone.

## Milestone 05 additions (2026-10-01)

The development Compose file pins `postgres:17.6-alpine` and `redis:7.4.5-alpine`, both official images. The database workspace adds `@prisma/adapter-pg` 7.10.0 to match Prisma, `pg` 8.16.3, `@types/pg` 8.15.5, and `redis` 5.10.0. These exact versions are in the manifest and lockfile. [Prisma 7's setup guide](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/v7/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/introduction) requires a driver adapter; [Redis's Node guide](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/clients/nodejs/connect/) documents `createClient`, bounded reconnection strategy, and connection events. Generation and TypeScript compilation passed. No prior direct dependency was upgraded.

## Local prerequisites observed

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `node --version`, `npm --version` | Both report **no active Node.js version configured** in this session. `nvm list` reports 24.21.0 installed, but `nvm` also reports registry access denied while reading/updating its environment. |
| `git --version` | 2.52.0.windows.1. `git status --short` reports this workspace is **not a Git repository**; the prior milestone state said it was, so verify the intended checkout before committing. |
| `docker --version` | Docker CLI 28.5.2. |
| `docker compose version` | Compose v2.40.3-desktop.1. |
| `docker info --format '{{.ServerVersion}}'` | Failed: access denied to Docker's config/engine pipe. Daemon availability is unverified; Docker is not needed for this documentation milestone. |
| Workspace | Documentation files only before this milestone; no app packages, `node_modules`, lockfile, database volume, or test runner. |
| Credentials | No `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `DATABASE_URL` environment-variable names were listed. Values were not read. Credentials are not needed for this milestone. |

## Reproduce and verify

Run these from the repository root. Native Windows uses the installed `nvm` executable; in Linux/WSL2 use your own Node version manager or the official Node 24.21.0 distribution. No global tool installation is part of this milestone.

**Windows PowerShell**

```powershell
nvm use 24.21.0
node --version
npm --version
git --version
docker --version
docker compose version
docker info --format '{{.ServerVersion}}'

# After the monorepo manifests are created in milestone 02:
npm install --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts
npm install
npm ls react react-dom vite typescript next prisma @prisma/client @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk zod vitest @playwright/test
```

**Linux / WSL2 (with `nvm-sh` already installed)**

```bash
nvm install 24.21.0
nvm use 24.21.0
node --version
npm --version
git --version
docker --version
docker compose version
docker info --format '{{.ServerVersion}}'

# After the monorepo manifests are created in milestone 02:
npm install --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts
npm install
npm ls react react-dom vite typescript next prisma @prisma/client @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk zod vitest @playwright/test
```

If `nvm use` fails on this Windows host, open a shell with permission to activate the already installed version or use the [official Node.js 24.21.0 installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/archive/v24.21.0). Check `node --version` before running npm. A resolved lockfile and any transitive peer checks await a working Node/npm session and milestone 02 manifests. Do not use `--legacy-peer-deps` to hide a conflict; resolve and document it.

## Milestone 06 verification — 2026-10-01

No direct dependencies were added or upgraded. Prisma/client/adapter remain 7.10.0.
Official [Prisma 7 migration/configuration docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/upgrade-prisma-orm/v7)
and installed CLI/types were checked for config, generation and migration commands.
The [Better Auth core schema](https://better-auth.com/docs/concepts/database) was checked for
User/Session/Account/Verification fields. Its runtime package/version is intentionally deferred to
milestone 07, which must validate the schema against the chosen maintained release.
PostgreSQL 17.6 successfully executed the initial SQL and numeric/check/relationship tests.

## Milestone 07 authentication — 2026-10-01

Added and pinned `better-auth` **1.7.7** in apps/api; resolved transitive dependencies are in package-lock.json. No existing direct dependency versions changed. Official Microsoft provider, Prisma adapter, Next.js integration, plugin endpoint, security and session documentation and installed types/source were checked; see ADR 0003. The milestone 06 auth schema works with this release, verified by real database login/logout tests. Explicit security flags override the library's test-mode defaults. Production startup exits on invalid config because Next.js can retain a process after instrumentation throws. Build warnings include existing Vite directive/Next instrumentation analysis warnings and analysis of the additional production exit.

## Milestone 08 APIs — 2026-10-01

No external dependency versions changed. The DB workspace now declares existing contracts/domain workspace dependencies; lockfile metadata refreshed. Prisma 7.10.0 installed transaction types and adapter error mapping and Next.js 16.3.8 bundled route documentation were checked. Current online Prisma docs have moved to ORM 8; use the installed pinned ORM 7 API. BigInt fixed-point arithmetic avoids introducing a decimal library or binary floating-point money calculations. See ADR 0004.

## Milestone 13 note (2026-10-02)

No dependency was added or upgraded. The outbox/stream code uses the already pinned `redis` 5.10.0
client and the Compose `redis:7.4.5-alpine` server. It requires Redis ≥ 7.0 for `XINFO STREAM`
`max-deleted-entry-id`/`recorded-first-entry-id`/`entries-added` and ≥ 6.2 for exclusive `XRANGE`.
Azure Managed Redis must be provisioned with a compatible engine version (checked in milestone 34).
PostgreSQL ≥ 13 is required for built-in `gen_random_uuid()` (Compose pins 17.6). `zod` stays only in
`contracts`; request schemas for new routes were added there rather than adding `zod` to `db`.


## Milestone 17 agent tools — 2026-10-02

No resolved package version changed and nothing was downloaded (`npm install --offline` against the
existing cache). `packages/agent` now declares `zod` **4.6.5** and, as a dev dependency,
`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` **1.31.0**. Both were already installed at the root as peers of
`@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` 0.3.276. The compatibility reason: SDK `tool()` input shapes must
come from the same Zod instance the in-process MCP server uses to validate arguments and generate
JSON Schema. `contracts` keeps its own pinned 4.6.4 for browser DTOs; agent tool schemas never mix
the two instances. The MCP SDK dev dependency is used only by tests (protocol-level `Client` and
`InMemoryTransport`) to verify registration. The lockfile change is metadata only: workspace
dependency entries and removed `peer` flags. APIs were verified in the installed `sdk.d.ts`
(`tool`, `createSdkMcpServer`, `Options.tools/allowedTools/disallowedTools/mcpServers/strictMcpConfig/
canUseTool/settingSources/skills/agents/plugins`) and the official
[custom tools](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/custom-tools) and
[tool search](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/tool-search) pages. See ADR 0010.

## Milestone 22 - 2026-10-02

No resolved dependency versions changed. The worker now declares the existing local agent and contracts workspaces to process owner-scoped news research before outbox acknowledgement. The lockfile records those workspace dependency additions. Prisma 7.10.0 generated AlertRule/AlertNotification types and Next.js 16.3.8 installed route-handler documentation were checked; official references are in ADR 0015. Offline installation restored workspace links copied as ordinary directories in this snapshot.

## Milestone 23 - 2026-10-02

No resolved versions changed. MCP SDK 1.31.0 moved from the agent's dev dependencies to runtime
dependencies because the bounded research wrapper and fixture server import it. Lockfile metadata
updated offline. Agent SDK 0.3.276 types and bundled CLI manifest 2.1.276 were checked against the
official subagent, MCP, hooks, streaming and cost docs (ADR 0016). Current official MCP docs also
describe v2; this milestone deliberately uses the already installed v1 APIs and transport buffer
implementation. Actual stdio process tests verify behavior. Native Claude delegation and reported
nested usage remain unverified without credentials; the opt-in comparison command is in lesson 23.

## Milestone 24 - 2026-10-02

No dependency versions or lockfile changed. SDK 0.3.276 / bundled CLI 2.1.276 types verify
settingSources, settings, skills, cwd, hooks, HookInput/HookCallback and startup control methods.
Official skills, hooks and settings pages were read (ADR 0017). An actual credential-free SDK
startup confirms application skills and hook registration with personal/ancestor configuration
excluded. Native briefing adherence is covered by an opt-in live test, unexecuted without credentials.


## Milestone 25 - 2026-10-02

No dependency versions or lockfile changed. SDK 0.3.276 / CLI 2.1.276 installed definitions
verify CanUseTool, PermissionResult, abort signal, updatedInput, interrupt, and PreToolUse
permissionDecision ask. Official permission/user-input docs checked; see ADR 0018.
Writes are excluded from preapproval, default mode reaches canUseTool, and handler checks remain
mandatory. Prisma 7.10.0 generated the new client; all fourteen migrations applied to a fresh
local PostgreSQL database. Next 16.3.8's installed Route Handler guide was read before editing.
